# Weather API or Bookshop API

This project is an introduction to what we can do with API. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Code editor is required to read the code in the file app.py
> Visual Studio Code

> Spyder 

You also have to install the requirements.txt

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

You just have to run the instructions.py that you can change these as you see fit.

For example, you can rename your Robot:
`first_robot = Robot("IRobot")
first_robot.state()`

Or ask to move on whatever direction:
`first_robot.move_on()
first_robot.turn_right()
first_robot.state()`

Or make it better:
`newgen_robot = RobotNG('Super Robot')`

And boost it:
`newgen_robot.boost()`
