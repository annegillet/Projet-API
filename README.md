# Weather API or Bookshop API

This project is an introduction to what we can do with API. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Code editor is required to read the code in the file app.py
> Visual Studio Code

> Spyder 

You also have to install the followed dependences:

```
pip install contextlib
pip install urllib.request
pip install dateutil.parser
pip install json
```

### Installing

You just have to run the Meteo.py or the Ma_petite_librairie.py 

Thanks to the Meteo.py you can be aware of the weather and the temperature of the town you choose thanks to this command:

`WEATHER[forecast[friday]['weather']], city['name'], city['cp'], forecast[friday]['tmax'])`
